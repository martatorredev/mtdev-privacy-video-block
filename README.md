A privacy-first WordPress plugin to load video embeds on consent, improving site performance, accessibility, and GDPR compliance.

## üßê Why Use This Plugin?

Embedding videos from platforms like YouTube or Vimeo directly on your site can introduce several issues:
* **Privacy Concerns:** They load tracking cookies before the user has given consent, which can be a problem under regulations like GDPR.
* **Performance:** Loading the full video player, even when it's not played, adds significant weight to your page, slowing it down.
* **Accessibility:** Default embeds often lack proper accessibility attributes.

## ‚ú® What It Does

**MTDEV Privacy Video Block** automatically detects video embeds on your pages and replaces them with a lightweight, accessible placeholder. The actual video is only loaded if the user explicitly clicks on the placeholder, ensuring that tracking scripts are not loaded without consent.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Privacy by Design:** No external requests or cookies until the user agrees. Helps with GDPR and ePrivacy compliance.
* **Performance Boost:** Drastically reduces initial page load time and weight by deferring video player loading.
* **Accessibility Ready:** The placeholder is designed with accessibility in mind, providing a better experience for all users.
* **Highly Customizable:** (You can add this later) Control the appearance of the placeholder via the Customizer.
* **Zero Configuration:** Works out of the box. Just install and activate.
* **Block Editor & Shortcode Support:** (You can add this later) Easily add privacy-enhanced videos using a dedicated block or a simple shortcode.
